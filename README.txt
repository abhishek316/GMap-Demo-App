GMap Demo App Version 1.0

The power of google maps made easy for your web or mobile apps with the jQuery Google Maps Plugin. This demo app, built with MDS AppLaud, shows dozens of google map examples using features like fusion tables, markers, info windows, clusters, events, microformats, geocoding, panoramio and directions. 

The jQuery Google Maps Plugin provides a simplified JavaScript API to google maps, enabling hassle-free creation and control of google maps. GMap Demo runs on Android phones or tablets - or on your desktop - and demonstrates the coolest google maps features using jQuery Mobile and jQuery UI Frameworks.

Mobile Developer Solutionsâ€™ AppLaud (Open Source Eclipse Plugin for PhoneGap / Android), enables web developers to start developing for the mobile web quickly. The AppLaud Eclipse plugin includes the latest versions of PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile. Sencha Touch libraries are easily included. This JavaScript, Java or hybrid development environment lets you quickly create and deploy your web apps to the Android Market.

Important: GMap Demo uses Google Maps JavaScript API v3 (requires network data connection) so please use wifi or enable data on your carrier connection to get the best response. Sharing device location not necessary, a default location will be used if geolocation is not available.
